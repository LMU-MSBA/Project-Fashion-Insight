## Project Description
#### In our project "Fashion Insight: Unveiling the Mystery Behind Rating Decline," our team aims to help the retail sector—specifically, companies involved in women's fashion athletic wear—by addressing declining customer satisfaction as evidenced by average product ratings. This problem is crucial for businesses relying on customer feedback to gauge product quality and service. It will be tackled using different analytical tools designed to offer actionable insights. These tools include dashboards for monitoring key performance metrics, diagnostic analytics to explore pricing and customer satisfaction relationships, automated data pipelines for real-time data updates, and predictive models to forecast future ratings. This approach is inspired by the job post for an Analytics Manager at Alo, which emphasized the need for analytics-driven decision-making in retail environments to enhance customer experiences and drive business growth. The selected job embodies the expertise and environment our team seeks to emulate, leveraging data analytics to craft strategies that tangibly improve business outcomes.
