# A/B Test 
## 1. Metrics
#### Key Performance Metrics: 
We chose the conversion rate as the percentage of visitors who complete a desired action such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. This directly ties into our objective of enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
#### Justification for Selection: 
We selected this metric because it allows us to measure the effectiveness of personalized recommendations in encouraging decisive user actions, which is crucial for our strategy in womenâ€™s fashion athletic wear.
#### Alignment with Objectives: 
A higher conversion rate in the experimental group would validate our hypothesis that personalized recommendations significantly boost user engagement, contributing directly to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.
## 2. Hypotheses
#### Null Hypothesis (H0): 
Personalized recommendations do not increase user engagement compared to generic recommendations.
#### Alternative Hypothesis (H1): 
Personalized recommendations result in higher user engagement compared to generic recommendations.
## 3. Experimental Design
#### Control and Experimental Groups: 
We will compare user experiences between two groups; the control group will see standard product recommendations while the experimental group receives personalized product recommendations generated by an AI algorithm.
#### Randomization Process: 
We will implement a JavaScript-based randomization mechanism on our site to ensure unbiased group assignment and consistent user experience.
#### Experiment Duration: 
We determined a 4-week testing period to allow for sufficient data collection and reliable analysis.
#### Sample Size Calculation: 
We calculated the need for approximately 500 users per group based on desired test power and significance levels to detect meaningful differences.
## 4. Implementation Plan
#### Technical Setup: 
We will set up our A/B testing environment using specific tools such as LaunchDarkly to manage feature flagging and user segmentation.
#### Timeline: 
Our timeline spans from preliminary setup to final reporting, accounting for potential adjustments based on initial findings.
#### Ethical Considerations: 
We are committed to transparency and will ensure all participants are informed about how their data is used in our tests, maintaining ethical standards throughout.
## 5. Data Collection and Analysis
#### Tools and Techniques: 
We will use advanced tools like Google Analytics to segment user data and track interactions, enhancing our dashboards with real-time updates.
#### Analytical Methods: 
We will employ statistical software like R and Python to perform rigorous data analysis, setting our alpha level at 0.05 to ensure significance.
#### Interpretation of Results: 
We will interpret our results by considering statistical outputs such as p-values and confidence intervals, allowing us to make informed decisions based on the test outcomes.
